# steps 

## Starting to merge SwitchColor to git. 

1. Creating the repo. --easier second time around, when not
	 creating a Readme. for starters. Made me get access to
	 commands for pushing initial commit.

2.  Research folder structure that works with plugin
		managaers. and create my own locally, add to repo.

3.  Determine files, in the package I really want to have.
		I should still be able to  update to vimscript.org, at
		least one last time!

	  I will hava a version.txt file, to signify the actual version.

4.  Create mye full local repo, commit the current version
		to github, and take it from there.

# File/folder structure:

Try with the standard vim directory names.
